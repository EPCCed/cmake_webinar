# Build instructions

You will need to install mkdocs-material. This can be installed as a python package

```
pip install mkdocs-material
```

The documentation can be built on the fly by running.

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

This will start a local server on localhost and display the address at which the documentation is served. By default this will be on localhost. Copy the address and paste it in the address bar of your favorite browser in order to browse the lessons.
