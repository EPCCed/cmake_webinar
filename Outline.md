- Go to the Hello World example and demonstrate the configure/build/install process
- Go to WindTunnel example and try to compile. Show how to see the list of variables and helper strings.
- Try to recompile `windtunnel` using the Intel compilers and Intel mpi. Demonstrate how to change the compilers and MPI.
- Try to recompile using the unwrapped MPI wrapper compiler and OpenMPI as the external compiler. The goal is to teach usage of `-DPACKAGE_NAME_ROOT` . Also show issues that can arise from the appropriate policy not being set.
